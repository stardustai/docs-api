## Why Data-Centric

The AI landscape has been revolutionized by data technology, with large language models empowering organizations to create "super employees" for unprecedented productivity gains. While deep learning algorithms are widely available and computing power is readily accessible, the true differentiator lies in the quality and refinement of training data.

Enterprises require a data pipeline that is not only discoverable, manageable, and collaborative but also iterative, enabling continuous refinement to achieve model perfection. This represents a paradigm shift towards data-centric internal collaboration, moving away from traditional human-centric approaches. By embracing this new paradigm, businesses can unlock greater efficiency and secure a significant competitive advantage in the AI 2.0 era.
